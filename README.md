# ACO Route Finder for Drive Tests

This project aims to take a road network (defined by an Overpass Turbo query and exported as GPX or GeoJSON) and use Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to find an efficient drive test route of a desired length that covers the specified roads.

The output will be a GPX file with ordered route points suitable for navigation in applications like Mapy.cz.
